If corrosion or food stains arise, or if food burns and sticks, the pot/pan can be cleaned with steel wool or an abrasive sponge and then re-seasoned. Use a hob with the same or a smaller diameter to save energy. The pot/pan gets hot during use. Therefore, always use pot holders when moving it.

The lid has a glass window that allows you to monitor the contents of the pot during the cooking process. The handle of the frying pan and sauteuse provides a comfortable and secure grip because it follows the contours of your hand and has silicon on the underside. The entire pan, including the base and sides, has one layer of aluminium between two layers of stainless steel.

The base of the frying pan is extra thick, which browns food beautifully and minimises the risk of food sticking  to the surface. The graduated interior makes it easy to measure up liquid directly in the pot and sauteuse. You can cook food on a low heat and save energy because the stainless steel in the pan absorbs heat well and retains it for a long time. Works well on all types of hobs, including induction hob.

If corrosion or food stains arise, or if food burns and sticks, the pot/pan can be cleaned with steel wool or an abrasive sponge and then re-seasoned. Use a hob with the same or a smaller diameter to save energy. The pot/pan gets hot during use. Therefore, always use pot holders when moving it.

The characteristic top shelf is a common feature in the entire HAUGA series and adds to the traditional style. Regardless if you use it for hats, boxes or decorations, the edge keeps your things in place.
